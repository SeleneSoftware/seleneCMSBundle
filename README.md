Getting the code from WaxLuna into a CMS bundle

## Overview
the site waxlunagames.com was built in a somewhat hurried fashion.  There has been some work to fix bugs and add features, but I want to release it to the wild.  So I'm going to extract the code from WaxLuna games and move it into a bundle that can be used to create sites that are managed by a CMS system.  Easy peasy.
